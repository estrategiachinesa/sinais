## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep red (#A61E1E) for a strong and attention-grabbing feel, influenced by the original background color (#ff2d2d) requested in the prompt, but adjusted for visual harmony.
- Background color: Very dark, desaturated red (#1A0505) provides a contrast for other elements, in keeping with the dark background and light text the prompt asked for.
- Accent color: A slightly lighter red than the primary color (#D42828) will draw the eye to calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and readable style. Its neutral style avoids overpowering the other elements of the design.
- Simple, clear icons to represent CALL (up arrow) and PUT (down arrow) signals.
- A responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring the site looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Subtle animations such as typing effects and loading animations to enhance user experience.
